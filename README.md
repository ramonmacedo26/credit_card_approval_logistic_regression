# credit_card_approval_logistic_regression
 
This is a personal project that I created for my portfolio as a data scientist. The data is from the UCI repository and refers to credit card approvals. The objective is to determine, based on the features, whether a request should or should not be approved. For this, the logistic regression algorithm was used.
